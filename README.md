# moving-app

This is a practice project in [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)'s course [Intro to AJAX](https://www.udacity.com/courses/ud110).

It's a one-page app which help you learn about a place. You can input a street address and a city, and a picture of the place will appear as the 
background. New York Times articles and relevant Wikipedia links about the city will show up, too.

Open index.html to run.
